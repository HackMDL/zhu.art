                    <p>My name is Alvina! I've been painting my whole life! I want to tell you how, in principle, it all
                        started! I will not
                        embellish and say that I always knew that art was my vocation, to be honest, I never made any
                        serious plans about
                        painting. I painted only for myself!</p>
                    <p>I entered the Academy of Arts without having any goals and plans ... Honestly, I have no idea how
                        I decided to go to
                        study in a foreign country, where I don't know anyone at all, I was very much afraid, everyone
                        discouraged me, but I
                        felt that I was on the right track! It was in the Academy that I realized who I am and who I
                        want to become! Everything
                        changed overnight! It was an exhibition-competition at the embassy, where I was a participant!
                    </p>
                    <p>So where did it all start? No, not from the competition and not even from that picture, to be
                        honest, that evening I did
                        not win anything, nothing special happened then. But still, after that evening, something has
                        changed! For the first
                        time I put my painting on public display!</p>
                    <p>And you know what? I like it! I liked the atmosphere, I liked the people. I realized that I want
                        to live such a life!</p>
                    <p>After that evening, I started telling my friends that I wanted to become a real artist, but they
                        looked at me in
                        bewilderment and did not understand what I was talking about, because I had been drawing all my
                        life and I already had 5
                        years of painting training behind me.</p>
                    <p>But for me there is a big difference between a person who just paints and an artist. An artist is
                        not a profession or a
                        hobby. An artist is a way of life!</p>
                    <p>Since then I have completely devoted my life to art!</p>

                    <h3>Artist statment</h3>
                    <p>The ability to create and declare oneself as an artist is what I live with now! I love that I can
                        bring beauty and
                        harmony to this world!</p>
                    <p>In my works, there is an interest in the human body, it is body language that helps me create
                        emotion in my paintings!</p>
                    <p>I carry the idea of loving myself and the world around us.</p>
                    <p>My works do not tell a story, the plots depicted on them should only evoke emotion: warmth,
                        comfort and harmony.</p>
                    <p>I am often asked: - "What is your picture about? What did you want to show in it?" - and I always
                        answer that what is
                        important is not what I wanted to say (show), much more important is what you saw in it! Each
                        person sees the world
                        around through the prism of his own self. Two people looking at the same object can see
                        completely different things.
                        Most often, looking at a picture, you do not see the author in it, you see a reflection of
                        yourself in it!</p>
